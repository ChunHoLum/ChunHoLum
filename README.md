## 👋 Hiiiii
Security engineer by day, occasional game jammer by night. Building guardrails, not gates.
## 🛡️ Security Philosophy
I believe security should enable innovation, not hinder it. My approach focuses on shifting security left and building security as code - because the most effective security is the one that feels invisible while keeping everything protected.
## 🔭 Current Focus
- Secure SDLC frameworks and solutions that developers `actually` want to use
- Building supply chain security solutions (SLSA Level 3, because trust but verify)
- Graph-based asset discovery systems for context-aware security monitoring
- Exploring the intersection of Kubernetes, cloud security, and automation
## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal
```bash
Languages: TypeScript, GoLang, Python, C#
Cloud: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible
Security: SAST/SCA/Container scanning, threat modeling, SIEM, IAM, and more...
Tools: Burp Suite, Zap, Semgrep, Snyk, Trivy, Cosign, and more...
```
## 🎮 When Not Securing Things
You might find me participating in Game Jamming, and building mini-games with Unity/Godot. Check out my game jam creations: chunholum.itch.io

## 🔐 Security Mantras
- "Vulnerabilities are just features waiting to be exploited"
- "Trust is good, verification is better"
- "The best security is invisible until you need it"
